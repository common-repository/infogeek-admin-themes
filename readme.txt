Add three new themes on the new wordpress admin user interface!

== Description ==
Add three new color themes in the admin UI of version 3.8 of wordpress.  Is not supported for real in previous versions.

The color themes are the the following:

Infogeek Clear 

Has the white as main color and blue as highlight. Is very clear theme for you backend, if you don\' like so much the high contrast.

Infogeek High Contrast

Has a main color of greenblue ( like the see ), secondary highlight colors of blue and black. Clear and helps much with distinction amount the different sections of the backend user interface.

XTND ( Extend )

A theme very close to the default theme but uses magenta instead of blue! Very nice looking variation!

For a little bonus. I have added, a folder within colors folder of the plugin called base-files. This folder contains the necessary files for you to generate new themes. Of course these files, at least the originals,  exist inside the colors folder within admin css. But i sense these will help you to make the work a little faster than the originals!

== Installation ==
1. Upload to your plugins folder or install it  directly from wordpress
2.Activate it
3.Go to Users -> Your Profile and find the extra themes!
